"""
Skeleton credential module for implementing PS credentials

The goal of this skeleton is to help you implementing PS credentials. Following
this API is not mandatory and you can change it as you see fit. This skeleton
only provides major functionality that you will need.

You will likely have to define more functions and/or classes. In particular, to
maintain clean code, we recommend to use classes for things that you want to
send between parties. You can then use `jsonpickle` serialization to convert
these classes to byte arrays (as expected by the other classes) and back again.

We also avoided the use of classes in this template so that the code more closely
resembles the original scheme definition. However, you are free to restructure
the functions provided to resemble a more object-oriented interface.
